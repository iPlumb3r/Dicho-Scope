# Subject VS Object 

Both __Subjects__ and __Object__ are __Concepts__

But __Subjects__ are the "veritable" center of interest of a given _Knowledge Domain_ ...   
... where __Objects__ are "just" representations - usualy documentary ones - of __subjects__

## Hello World Example 

A Person is __Subject__.  
An ID Card (of a Person) is an __Object__

## PLM Example 
A "Cahier de Charges" is a __Object__.  
An "As Required Product" is the corresponding __Subject__
