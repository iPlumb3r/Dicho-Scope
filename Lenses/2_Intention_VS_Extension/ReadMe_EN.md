# "Intention VS Extension" lens

 This dichotomy makes it possible to distinguish 2 main fundamental categories of products.

On the other hand, there are the "intentional" products which are defined by "what they __do", by the purpose they embody, such as for example the product "as required", the product "as designed", the product "as to be manufactured", the product "as to be sold", ... in short, all types of products which correspond to the main deliverable of the main activities of the product lifecycle management process (Definition, Design, Industrialization, Production, Distribution, Sales, ...).  
=> "Business" model

On the one hand, there are the "natural" (or "extensional") products, which are defined by "what they __are", by their incarnation in space-time, such as airplanes, cars, computers, clothing, books, food, services ... in short, all the categories (and sub-categories) of products found in "nature".   
=> Model "product"

In order to determine unambiguously "which product we are talking about", it is necessary to specify on which "intersection" it is located. For example:

* An "as designed" truck
* An "as to be build" engine
* An "as manufactured" gearbox
 â€¦

In this way, each "intersection" product is thus characterized by both : 
* the characteristics (dimension, size, shape, texture, ...) of the "extensional" product to which it belongs, 
* but also by the characteristics (code, label, price, delivery times, ...) of its "intentional" reference product.
